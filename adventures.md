## Outdoor Guiding

Outdoor education is a side-passion of mine. It began the summer after finishing undergraduate at Purdue where I guided 21-day overnight trips across the Hawaiian islands through [Wilderness Adventures](https://www.wildernessadventures.com). Here, I discovered a passion for teaching new skills and life-long hobbies while cultivating a love for the outdoors. As a part of this, I earned my Wilderness First Responder (WFR) to make sure I am leading with safety in mind. 

Now, I live in Austin, TX where I guide outdoor trips for a nonprofit called [Explore Austin](https://exploreaustin.org). My favorite activities to guide are mountain biking, canoeing, and general outdoor medicine/skills. It is incredibly rewarding to give back to the community & get to play outside on weekends with a world-changing organization. During the summers, we guide week-long overnight trips where the kids put the skills they learned during the year to the test. 

## Pictures from playing outside

Some of the photos shown here are from guiding trips: Most are from making the best of every weekend. I love talking about composites, inverse problems & research; I really love talking about the outdoors and your recent adventures! Reach out & share pictures you snapped along the trail.
