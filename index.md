I am a Ph.D. student in the [Walker School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.utexas.edu/) where I am co-advised by [Dr. Omar Ghattas](http://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar) and [Dr. Mehran Tehrani](https://sites.utexas.edu/tehrani/). Funded by a NASA NSTGRO fellowship, I am interested in developing industry 4.0 tools for composites manufacturing. Specifically, the technology I aim to enhance with computational tools is In-Situ Consolidation of Thermoplastic Composites (ICAT). ICAT has potential to be both a high-rate and sustainable approach. I balance my time running experiments in a lab and programming computational methods. Some key areas of interest are: real-time bayesian inversion, uncertainty quantification, fiber composite, solid mechanics, and materials characterization. <br>

I obtained my Bachelors in Aeronautics and Astronautics from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE) in Spring 2022 with a specialization in Structures and Materials. Here, I studied under [Dr. Byron Pipes](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=1436) and [Dr. Eduardo Barocio](https://www.purdue.edu/cmsc/tech-area-bio/barocio.php). My research focused on thermoelastic warpage, additive manufacturing of continuous fiber composites, and characterization. I was awarded an (Astronaut Scholarship Foundation)[https://astronautscholarship.org/] for these efforts. <br>

Building experience in industry includes two internships with (The Boeing Company)[https://www.boeing.com/], both in composites research & development roles. These roles provide perspective for my current research. Previously, I researched with (Dr. Cate Brinson)[https://mems.duke.edu/faculty/catherine-brinson] through an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates at Duke University. My first exposure to research - and composites - was at North Carolina State University with (Dr. Mark Pankow)[https://www.mae.ncsu.edu/blast]. Each experience provided a unique perspective on the world around us, helping me take steps towards where I am now. <br>
