## Research highlights
My research currently sits at the intersection of advanced composite processing and computational science, particularly focusing on inverse problems and outer-loop settings. Through the utilization of cutting-edge computational tools, my aim is threefold: first, to deepen our understanding of the fundamental science behind manufacturing methods; second, to develop real-time monitoring and certification techniques for performance; and third, to optimize the manufacturing process itself. My work is supported by a prestigious NASA NSTGRO fellowship entitled "Data-Driven Modeling and Optimization of Robotic In-situ Consolidation of Thermoplastic Composites," despite my current emphasis being more on model-driven methods rather than data-driven ones. However, I am eager to strike a balance between these two philosophies as my research progresses. This is a research direction I am intrigued by, particularly in the manufacturing setting where modeling the process with physics-alone is likely intractable.
